Description:
Archives a mysql database table in small bite size portions. For example, if your database regularly reaches a 4GB limit and you would like to move two weeks of data to another table (tablename_date) that will simply archive the data; this script handles the process at whatever pace suits your system. It defaults to copying and deleting 10 records every 5 seconds, but is customizable.

Provide the database login info, table name and field name for time stamp comparisons to the script along with a time stamp to begin and end. Other options include the number of records per transaction and time to sleep between transactions.

The script requires the following gems: mysql, cooloptions, log4r and strscan.

I've handled a lot of errors and different cases but please test it before you use it on your live database!

Contributions to the code are very welcome. My top priority is to abstract the fixed time variables so it's possible to easily archive 2 weeks, 1 week or 1 day (etc) prior. This would be extremely helpful since it would make it simple to add cron jobs for schedule d archives. I'm sure there are plenty of other possible extensions. Feel free to tinker.
